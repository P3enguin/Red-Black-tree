# Red-Black-tree
Red-Black tree is a self-balancing binary search tree, with each node colored either Black or Red.

# difference between normal and self-balancing binary search trees

the normal ones ,in some cases , have linear time complexity "O(n)" when searching for an elemenet.
To solve this problem and to make the time complexity always linear "O(log(n))" we use self-balancing trees.
this ones has set of rules , that It balance itself everytime one of the rules get violated . Usually in insertion and deletion


# Red-Black trees Properties and rules : 

 1 - the root is always black .
 2 - the nodes are either red or black.
 3 - every new inserted node is colored black.
 4 - there cant be two consecutive red nodes .
 5 - All paths from a given node to Its leaf should have the same number of black nodes in Its left and right direction .
